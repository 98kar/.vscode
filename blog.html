                                    Friend is defined as one person attached to another person by affection or esteem. As an old saying goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed. Having a friend can change our daily life in many ways including studies, works, entertainments, and so on. There are many different kinds of friends and they can change our life in different ways. In this essay, we classify friends by how close our relationship between each other is. From this standard, friends can be divided into three parts, which are close friends, ordinary friends and distant friends. Close friends are the people who can share almost everything whatever happiness or frustration. In other words, close friends are your extremely important friends in your whole life. Meanwhile, ordinary friends mean common and general because they don't share their situations with you on their own initiative. Whether they help you or not depends on their mood. When it comes to distant friends, the first sensation is unreliable. When you ask them about their situations, they would like to choose some unimportant things to tell you. When something happens, we will never ask them for help. The following are detailed introductions of three types of friends. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The close friends 
                                    The close friend is the person who is willing to tell you the recent development or trouble on their own initiative. When you deal with any problems, they will do their best to help you walk away from trouble. The close friend is the person you don’t need to try to keep contact with them intentionally and he or she will understand you in the heart. Besides, the close friends are aware of your deepest and darkest secrets. They even can proudly say that there is nothing about you that they don’t know. Maybe it is some exaggeration but basically the case. In other words, if you have some things to hide from them, there 
                                    is no doubt that you won’t talk them with anyone. What’s more, they are also conscious of your weakness. In addition to tolerating and encouraging you, they will actively point out your shortcomings with the hope that you can become better. They want to be with you and grow with you. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The ordinary friends 
                                    Ordinary friends are the people who we will not take the initiative to talk about our life with unless if we are asked by them. Actually, most of our friends are ordinary friends. When we have difficulty, we sometimes ask ordinary friends for help. Firstly, when we are in trouble and need help, these friends will have the subjective choice of help, they will think about whether it is worthwhile to help you, and if they think it is very troublesome to them, they may choose to refuse. What's more, they may consider whether it can be beneficial for them after helping you even though they have the ability to deal with the trouble. It is the same for us. Secondly, ordinary friends know each other's life style. Most of ordinary friends are our classmates or colleagues because even in spare time we still spend at least 50% of time at work. Statistics show that the more isolated you are at work, the more depressed you get. So it makes sense to get a ordinary friend to chat with at the water cooler and to help us get through the work. Ordinary friends would spend lots of time together to work together and amuse themselves during spare time. Ordinary friends will understand your inner thoughts and know some of your secrets. You are willing to share your happiness and sorrow, however, you don't want them to know some of your deepest secrets. You may talk with them when you are upset, but you will hide yourself and not completely open your heart. Thirdly, as the saying goes "Friendship can't stand always on one side." Friends always have different ideas. When we have a long time to communicate with ordinary friends, we will see the shortcomings of each other. For these shortcomings, we will selectively propose, but only put forward some superficial problems, such as shortcomings in work and study. Or sometimes we put forward some problems obscurely but we do not bring up such deep-seated problems like personality.

                                    The Distant Friends 
                                    Distant friends are the people who you tell them selectively when you are asked about recent situation. To some extent, they may be external friends. When you encounter a problem, you would not like to ask those friends for help. For example, if you are bearing huge pressure caused by your job and you yearn for someone to company with you or chat with you to relieve the pressure, you will call your best fiends rather than distant friends even you do not consider them to help you. Therefore, this kind of friends don't know your secrets at all. Also, you don't know their secrets and you do not share your secrets with each other. Besides, distant friends may get along with you by a peaceful way, which means that they won't point out your faults even though they may have found them. Assuming that your dress is stained with tomato sauce with incaution, to which you don't pay attention, these friends won't tell you it as if they don't mind it. As far as they are concerned, it's none of their business whether you behave well or bad.

                                    Conclusion 
                                    In a nutshell, friends can be divided into three categories, intimate friends, ordinary friends, and distant friend. On our journeys, we will encounter many friends and they can make us delightful. Some friends walk side by side with us witnessing to the ebb and flow together, however some friends just get along with our in short. In any case, they will be an indispensable part of our life.
